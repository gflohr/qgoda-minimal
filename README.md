# Qgoda-minimal

Minimal theme for Qgoda

## Description

This theme contains the bare minimum to start a Qgoda project with.

## Requirements

The only requirement is [qgoda](http://www.qgoda.net/).  See
http://www.qgoda.net/en/docs/installation/ for instructions.

## Usage

There is no need to clone this repository unless you want to extend it!

The theme can be used like this:

```shell
$ mkdir qgoda-minimal
$ cd qgoda-minimal
$ qgoda init gflohr/qgoda-minimal
$ qgoda watch
```

This will install the theme in the newly created directory `qgoda-minimal`
and build - an also pretty minimal - site in the directory `_site`.

Open the file `_site/index.html` in your browser for documentation of the
theme.
